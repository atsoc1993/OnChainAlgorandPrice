### Details:
This code and paired youtube video go over getting the price of Algorand on-chain using a smart contract via testnet.

There is also a method from which you can input an amount of USD eg; $1000 and receive an output that is the equivalent amount in Algorand.

Note that the scaling factors were adjusted post-recording for a more accurate decimal representation.
